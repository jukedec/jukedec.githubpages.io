NOTE:
## Purpose of the talk
- I like the idea of controlling our own livelihoods
- Strong feelings against corporate world and money in general
- Are there any students here?
- I'm NOT a professional consultant
    - Any interest?

## Problem

- Artists don't get paid
- Performance Rights Organizations
    - PR is a legal licensing term that applies to playing a music recording in public place
- Streamers' DMCA

Note:

- How I met Craig
